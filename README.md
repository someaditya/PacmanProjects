# PacmanProjects
The Pac-Man projects were developed for UC Berkeley's introductory artificial intelligence course, CS 188. They apply an array of AI techniques to playing Pac-Man. The same project was assigned for the module CS7IS2 (Artificial Intelligence) at Trinity College Dublin, Ireland for MSc. Computer Science (2017-18).

# Projects Overview

Search 
Students implement depth-first, breadth-first, uniform cost, and A* search algorithms. These algorithms are used to solve navigation and traveling salesman problems in the Pacman world.


Multi-Agent Search 
Classic Pacman is modeled as both an adversarial and a stochastic search problem. Students implement multiagent minimax and expectimax algorithms, as well as designing evaluation functions.


Reinforcement Learning 
Students implement model-based and model-free reinforcement learning algorithms, applied to the AIMA textbook's Gridworld, Pacman, and a simulated crawling robot.


Ghostbusters 
Probabilistic inference in a hidden Markov model tracks the movement of hidden ghosts in the Pacman world. Students implement exact inference using the forward algorithm and approximate inference via particle filters.


Classification 
Students implement standard machine learning classification algorithms using Naive Bayes, Perceptron, and MIRA models to classify digits. Students extend this by implementing a behavioral cloning Pacman agent.
