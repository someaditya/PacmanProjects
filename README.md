# PacmanProjects
The Pac-Man projects were developed for UC Berkeley's introductory artificial intelligence course, CS 188. They apply an array of AI techniques to playing Pac-Man. The same project was assigned for the module CS7IS2 (Artificial Intelligence) at Trinity College Dublin, Ireland for MSc. Computer Science (2017-18).
